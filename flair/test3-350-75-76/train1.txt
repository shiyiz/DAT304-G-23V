Each

to
tell
the

But
for

will
use
by
tampering
with
the
byte

aka,
not

Rasa
is
an
open
source
machine
learning
framework
to
automate
text-and

conversations.
In
affected
versions
a
vulnerability
exists
in
the
functionality
that
loads
a
trained
model
`tar.gz`
file

allows
a
malicious
actor
to
craft
a
`model.tar.gz`

For
users
unable

eLabFTW
is
an
open
source
electronic
lab
notebook
manager
for
research
teams.
In
versions
of
eLabFTW
before
4.1.0,
it
allows
attackers
to
bypass
a
brute-force
protection
mechanism
by
using
many
different
forged
PHPSESSID
values
in
HTTP
Cookie
header.
This
issue
has
been
addressed
by
implementing
brute
force
login
protection,
as
recommended
by
Owasp
with
Device
Cookies.
This
mechanism
will
not
impact
users
and
will
effectively
thwart
any
brute-force
attempts
at
guessing
passwords.
The
only
correct
way
to
address
this
is
to
upgrade
to
version
4.1.0.
Adding
rate
limitation
upstream
of
the
eLabFTW
service
is
of
course
a
valid
option,
with
or
without
upgrading.

TensorFlow
is
an
open
source
platform
for
machine
learning.
In
affected
versions
the
process
of
building
the
control
flow
graph
for
a
TensorFlow
model
is
vulnerable
to
a
null
pointer
exception
when
nodes
that
should
be
paired
are
not.
This
occurs
because
the
code
assumes
that
the
first
node
in
the
pairing
(e.g.,
an
`Enter`
node)
always
exists
when
encountering
the
second
node
(e.g.,
an
`Exit`
node).
When
this
is
not
the
case,
`parent`
is
`nullptr`
so
dereferencing
it
causes
a
crash.
The
fix
will
be
included
in
TensorFlow
2.7.0.
We
will
also
cherrypick
this
commit
on
TensorFlow
2.6.1,
TensorFlow
2.5.2,
and
TensorFlow
2.4.4,
as
these
are
also
affected
and
still
in
supported
range.

A

Handle
after
Effective
Lifetime
vulnerability
in
plugable
authentication
module
(PAM)
of
Juniper
Networks
Junos
OS
and
Junos
OS
Evolved
allows
a
locally
authenticated
attacker
with
low
privileges
to
cause
a
Denial
of
Service
(DoS).
It
is
possible
that
after
the
termination
of
a
gRPC
connection
the
respective/var/run/<pid>.env
file
is
not
getting
deleted
which
if
occurring
repeatedly
can
cause
inode
exhaustion.
Inode
exhaustion
can
present
itself
in
two
different
ways:
1.
The
following
log
message
can
be
observed:
host
kernel:
pid
<pid>
(<process>),
uid
<uid>
inumber
<number>
on
/.mount/var:
out
of
inodes
which
by
itself
is
a
clear
indication.
2.
The
following
log
message
can
be
observed:
host
<process>[<pid>]:
...
:
No
space
left
on
device
which
is
not
deterministic
and
just
a
representation
of
a
write
error
which
could
have
several
reasons.
So
the
following
check
needs
to
be
done:
user@host>
show
system
storage
no-forwarding
Filesystem
Size
Used
Avail
Capacity
Mounted
on
/dev/ada1p1
475M
300M
137M
69%
/.mount/var
which
indicates
that
the
write
error
is
not
actually
due
to
a
lack
of
disk
space.
If
either
1.
or
2.
has
been
confirmed,
then
the
output
of:
user@host>
file
list
/var/run/*.env
|
count
need
to
be
checked
and
if
it
indicates
a
high

the

A
buffer
overrun
can
be
triggered
in
X.509
certificate
verification,
specifically
in
name
constraint
checking.
Note
that
this
occurs
after
certificate
chain
signature
verification
and
requires
either
a
CA
to
have
signed
a
malicious
certificate
or
for
an
application
to
continue
certificate
verification
despite
failure
to
construct
a
path
to
a
trusted
issuer.
An
attacker
can
craft
a
malicious
email
address
in
a
certificate
to
overflow
an
arbitrary
number
of
bytes
containing
the
`.'
character
(decimal
46)
on
the
stack.
This
buffer
overflow
could
result
in
a
crash
(causing
a
denial
of
service).
In
a
TLS
client,
this
can
be
triggered
by
connecting
to
a
malicious
server.
In
a
TLS
server,
this
can
be
triggered
if
the
server
requests
client

in
the
out

management
interface
IP
table
rule
programming
for
Cisco
Application
Policy
Infrastructure
Controller
(APIC)
could
allow

ports
would
be
permitted
to
the
OOB
management
interface

in
fact,
the
packets
should
be
dropped.
The
vulnerability
is
due
to
the
configuration

specific
IP
table
entries
for
which
there
is
a
programming
logic
error

A
vulnerability
has
been
identified
in

attackers
to
execute
arbitrary
code
on
affected
installations
of
Foxit
PDF
Reader
11.0.0.49893.
User
interaction
is
required
to
exploit
this
vulnerability
in
that
the
target
must
visit
a
malicious
page
or
open
a
malicious
file.
The
specific
flaw
exists
within
the
handling
of
Annotation
objects.
The
issue
results
from
the
lack
of
validating
the
existence
of
an
object
prior
to
performing
operations
on
the
object.
An
attacker
can
leverage
this
