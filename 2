The
vulnerability
is
caused
by
a

Crafted
input
causes
a
mismatch
between

achieve
arbitrary
code
execution.

OpenSSL
1.0.2
(starting
from
version
1.0.2b)
introduced
an
"error
state"
mechanism.
The
intent
was
that
if
a
fatal
error
occurred
during
a
handshake
then
OpenSSL
would
move
into
the
error
state
and
would
immediately
fail
if
you
attempted
to
continue
the
handshake.
This
works
as
designed
for
the
explicit
handshake
functions
(SSL_do_handshake(),
SSL_accept()
and
SSL_connect()),
however
due
to
a
bug
it
does
not
work
correctly
if
SSL_read()
or
SSL_write()
is
called
directly.
In
that
scenario,
if
the
handshake
fails
then
a
fatal
error
will
be
returned
in
the
initial
function
call.
If
SSL_read()/SSL_write()
is
subsequently
called
by
the
application
for
the
same
SSL
object
then
it
will
succeed
and
the
data
is
passed
without
being
decrypted/encrypted
directly
from
the
SSL/TLS
record
layer.
In
order
to
exploit
this
issue
an
application
bug
would
have
to
be
present
that
resulted
in
a
call
to
SSL_read()/SSL_write()
being
issued
after
having
already
received
a
fatal
error.
OpenSSL
version
1.0.2b-1.0.2m
are
affected.
Fixed
in
OpenSSL
1.0.2n.
OpenSSL
1.1.0
is
not
affected.

A

Following

for
the
local
Web
interface

then
be

An
issue
was
discovered
in

The
code
for

access
a

network
incoming
fragment
that
still
doesn't
have
a
reference
to
the
previous
one
(which
supposedly
resides
in
the

list).
When
faced
with
an
incoming
fragment
that
belongs
to
a
non-empty
fragment
list,
IPv6
reassembly
must
check
that
there
are
no
empty
holes
between
the
fragments:
this
leads
to
an
uninitialized
pointer
dereference
in
_fnet_ip6_reassembly
in

and
causes
Denial-of-Service.

in
the
out
of
band
(OOB)
management
interface
IP
table
rule
programming
for
Cisco
Application
Policy
Infrastructure
Controller
(APIC)
could
allow
an
unauthenticated,
remote
attacker
to
bypass
configured
deny
entries

specific
IP
ports.
These
IP
ports
would
be
permitted
to
the
OOB
management
interface
when,
in
fact,
the
packets
should
be
dropped.
The
vulnerability
is
due
to
the
configuration
of
specific
IP
table
entries
for
which
there
is
a
programming
logic
error
that
results
in
the
IP

An
attacker
could
exploit
this
vulnerability
by
sending
traffic
to
the
OOB
management
interface
on

targeted
device.
A
successful
exploit
could

The
attacker
has

in
the
JavaScript
implementation
of
Nitro
Pro
PDF.
A
specially
crafted
document
can
cause
an
object
containing
the
path
to
a
document
to
be
destroyed
and
then
later
reused,
resulting
in
a
use-after-free
vulnerability,
which
can
lead
to
code
execution
under
the
context
of
the
application.
An
attacker
can
convince
a
user
to
open
a
document
to
trigger
this
vulnerability.

A
stack-based
buffer
overflow
vulnerability
exists
in
the
command-line-parsing
HandleFileArg
functionality
of
AT&T
Labs’
Xmill
0.7.
Within
the
function
HandleFileArg
the
argument
filepattern
is
under
control
of
the
user
who
passes
it
in
from
the
command
line.
filepattern
is
passed
directly
to
strcpy
copying
the
path
provided
by
the
user
into
a
static
sized
buffer
without
any
length
checks
resulting
in
a
stack-buffer
overflow.
An
attacker
can
provide
malicious
input
to
trigger
these
vulnerabilities.

to
execute

interaction
is

exploit
this
vulnerability
in
that

The
specific
flaw
exists
within
the

The
issue
results
from
the
lack
of
validating
the

TensorFlow

platform
for

learning.
In
affected
versions
the
process
of
building
the

flow
graph
for
a
TensorFlow
model
is
vulnerable
to
a
null
pointer
exception
when
nodes
that
should
be
paired
are
not.
This
occurs
because
the
code
assumes
that
the
first
node
in
the
pairing
(e.g.,
an
`Enter`
node)
always
exists
when
encountering
the
second
node
(e.g.,
an
`Exit`
node).
When
this
is
not
the
case,
`parent`
is
`nullptr`
so
dereferencing
it
causes
a
crash.
The
fix
will
be
included
in

Effective

vulnerability
in
plugable
authentication
module
(PAM)
of
Juniper
Networks
Junos
OS
and
Junos
OS
Evolved
allows
a
locally
authenticated
attacker
with
low
privileges
to
cause
a
Denial

It
is
possible
that
after
the
termination
of
a
gRPC
connection
the
respective/var/run/<pid>.env
file
is
not
getting
deleted
which
if
occurring
repeatedly
can
cause
inode
exhaustion.
Inode
exhaustion
can
present
itself
in
two
different
ways:
1.
The
following
log
message
can
be
observed:
host
kernel:
pid
<pid>
(<process>),
uid
<uid>
inumber
<number>
on
/.mount/var:
out
of
inodes
which
by
itself
is
a
clear
indication.
2.
The
following
log
message
can
be
observed:
host
<process>[<pid>]:
...
:
No
space
left
on
device
which
is
not
deterministic
and
just
a
representation
of
a
write
error
which
could
have
several
reasons.
So
the
following
check
needs
to
be
done:
user@host>
show
system
storage
no-forwarding
Filesystem
Size
Used
Avail
Capacity
Mounted
on
/dev/ada1p1
475M
300M
137M
69%
/.mount/var
which
indicates
that
the
write
error
is
not
actually
due
to
a
lack
of
disk
space.
If
either
1.
or
2.
has
been
confirmed,
then
the
output
of:
user@host>
file
list
/var/run/*.env
|
count
need
to
be
checked
and
if
it
indicates

A
buffer
overrun
can
be
triggered
in
X.509
certificate
verification,
specifically
in
name
constraint
checking.
Note
that
this
occurs
after
certificate
chain
signature
verification

requires
either
a
CA
to
have
signed
a
malicious
certificate
or
for
an
application
to
continue
certificate
verification
despite
failure
to
construct
a
path
to
a
trusted
issuer.
An
attacker
can
craft
a

in
a
certificate
to
overflow
an
arbitrary
number
of

this
can
be
triggered

The
demon
image
annotation
plugin
for
WordPress
is
vulnerable
to
improper
input
validation
in
versions
up
to,
and
including
5.0.
This
is
due
to
the
plugin
improperly
validating
the
number
of
characters
supplied
during
an
annotation
despite
there
being
a
setting
to
limit
the
number
characters
input.
This
means
that
unauthenticated
attackers
can
bypass
the
length
restrictions
and
input
more
characters
than
allowed
via
the
settings.

---966---
On
Windows,
restricted
files
can
be
accessed
via
os.DirFS
and
http.Dir.
The
os.DirFS
function
and
http.Dir
type
provide
access
to
a
tree
of
files
rooted
at
a
given
directory.
These
functions
permit
access
to
Windows
device
files
under
that
root.
For
example,
os.DirFS("C:/tmp").Open("COM1")
opens
the
COM1
device.
Both
os.DirFS
and
http.Dir
only
provide
read-only
filesystem
access.
In
addition,
on
Windows,
an
os.DirFS
for
the
directory
(the
root
of
the
current
drive)
can
permit
a
maliciously
crafted
path
to
escape
from
the
drive
and
access
any
path
on
the
system.
With
fix
applied,
the
behavior
of
os.DirFS("")
has
changed.
Previously,
an
empty
root
was
treated
equivalently
to
"/",
so
os.DirFS("").Open("tmp")
would
open
the
path
"/tmp".
This
now
returns
an
error.

A
vulnerability
in

interface
of
Cisco
Small
Business
RV340,
RV340W,
RV345,
and
RV345P
Dual
WAN

Routers
could
allow
an
authenticated,
remote
attacker
to
execute
arbitrary
code
or
cause
the
web-based
management
process
on
the
device
to
restart
unexpectedly,
resulting
in
a
denial
of
service
(DoS)
condition.
The
attacker
must
have
valid
administrator
credentials.
This
vulnerability
is
due
to
insufficient
validation
of
user-supplied
input
to
the
web-based
management
interface.
An
attacker
could
exploit
this
vulnerability
by
sending
crafted
HTTP
input
to
an
affected
device.
A
successful
exploit
could
allow
the
attacker
to
execute
arbitrary
code
as
the
root
user
on
the
underlying
operating
system
or
cause
the
web-based
management
process

library
that

has
an
out-of-bounds
read
when

The
length
of
the
`av_pair`

not
checked
properly
for
two

elements
which
can
trigger
an
out-of-bound

The
out-of-bounds
read
can
be
triggered
via
the
main
`gss_accept_sec_context`
entry
point
and
could
cause
a
denial-of-service

the
memory
is
unmapped.

Platform
(Web

-
versions
420,

allows
an
attacker
to
inject
arbitrary
values
as
CMS
parameters
to
perform
lookups
on
the
internal
network
which
is
otherwise
not
accessible
externally.
On
successful
exploitation,
attacker
can
scan
internal
network
to
determine
internal
infrastructure
for
further
attacks
like
remote
file
inclusion,
retrieve
server

disclosure.
This
causes
